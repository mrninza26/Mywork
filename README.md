# ðŸ¤– Hi, Iâ€™m Anya!

Iâ€™m an early-stage ML enthusiast exploring how data and algorithms can solve real-world problems.  
Graduated with a degree in Applied Math last year and now Iâ€™m experimenting with **Python**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**.

I love playing with small datasets, training basic models, and trying to make sense of the results.  
Right now, Iâ€™m taking online courses on deep learning and dreaming of contributing to an open-source NLP project someday.

Always open to advice, collabs, and new ideas!
